Description:
ARK: Survival Evolved is a video game where you tame creatures and try to survive on an island full of dinosaurs and other creatures.
I decided to make soundboard app that focuses on different sounds of the creatures in the game.
You can also add the dinos you tamed and and keep track of them.

Persistance:
App is persistant in its design. first 3 menus have the same layout and are using the same sized buttons.
They are also both using scroll view layout.
the last two menu pages are persistent as well since they both are using the same layout and they feel like adition functionality has been added to the app.

UX/DX:
There are overall 5 manus to choose from. However, one of those menus is hidden since you are already on it.
Also, the last menu item which is View Dino is hidden until you add a dino.
